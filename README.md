Adding a Maker's Mark to 3D Prints
==================================

This repository contains a couple of examples of the approach I discuss in my
[blog post](https://markembling.info/2020/04/adding-makers-mark-3d-prints) on this topic.

These example code files are shared under [Creative Commons 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), 
except where otherwise indicated, and may therefore be used any way you wish. 
Attribution would be appreciated but is not required.

logo-on-simple-model.scad
-------------------------

This file shows stamping a logo into a simple model which is also constructed in
the file. In this case, it's just a cylinder with some text, but you could
imagine a more useful model where you want to add a logo.

logo-on-existing-stl.scad
-------------------------

This file shows stamping a logo into a pre-existing STL model.

The pre-existing model I used was the [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-face-shield)

Shared here for example purposes - this remix is not intended for use. 
Please see the original URL for the current/latest version of this model.

This is just an example logo (a gear with a speech bubble) for example purposes.
It's definitely not a work of art and is intended just as a placeholder for
illustration purposes.
